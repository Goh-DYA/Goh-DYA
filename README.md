## üëã Hello! Welcome to my GitHub repository üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

- I am Adison Goh, a data scientist / AI-ML practitioner at the National Healthcare Group (NHG), Singapore & a MSc in Business Analytics graduate from the National University of Singapore (NUS).
- With a deep curiosity for integrating cutting-edge technology and real-world solutions, I've embarked on various ML/AI projects throughout my learning journey, which are outlined below.
- Projects primarily involving Python notebooks were also uploaded onto my [Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/adisongoh/code).
