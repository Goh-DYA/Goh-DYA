## üëã Hello! Welcome to my GitHub repository üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

- I am Adison Goh, an aspiring data scientist & NUS MSc in Business Analytics student at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
- With a deep curiosity for integrating cutting-edge technology and real-world solutions, I've embarked on numerous ML/AI projects throughout my learning journey, which are outlined below.


## Project Overview
1. [Computer Vision](#computer-vision)
2. [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](#nlp)
3. [Tabular Data (Classical ML & Explainable AI)](#classicml)
